# Text-Summarizer
## Introduction

The technique, where a computer program shortens longer texts and generates summaries to pass the intended message, is defined as Automatic Text Summarization and is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

Text summarization is the process of creating a short, coherent, and fluent summary of a longer text document and involves the outlining of the text’s major points.

Text identification, interpretation and summary generation, and analysis of the generated summary are some of the key challenges faced in the process of text summarization. The critical tasks in extraction-based summarization are identifying key phrases in the document and using them to discover relevant information to be included in the summary.

The Flask app is finally deployed to Heroku.

## Conclusion

Text content is available in very large amounts and one can spend hours on reading and analyzing the text. Text summarization is very essential and required now more than ever. While investigating reports, outlines make the determination procedure simpler. Also reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can ﬁt in an area..
